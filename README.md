# Restaurants Search

My first finished React Native project created while following [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=959700). It allows you to search for some restaurants in Warsaw, while spliting them into three price categories. Not particularly useful whatsoever, but I begin to really like the idea of creating mobile apps using React and I will be definitely using it in some feature projects.
